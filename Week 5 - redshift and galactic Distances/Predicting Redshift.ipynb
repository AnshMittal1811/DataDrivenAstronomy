    "# In this activity, we're going to use decision trees to determine the redshifts of galaxies from their photometric colours. We'll use galaxies where accurate spectroscopic redshifts have been calculated as our gold standard. We will learn how to assess the accuracy of the decision trees predictions and have a look at validation of our model.\n",
    "# We will also have a quick look at how this problem might be approached without using machine learning. This will highlight some of the limitations of the classical approach and demonstrate why a machine learning approach is ideal for this type of problem.\n",
    "# If you want to run your code offline, you can download the full NumPy dataset for this activity here.\n",

    "# The astronomical colour (or colour index) is the difference between the magnitudes of two filters, i.e. u - g or i - z.\n",
    "# This index is one way to characterise the colours of galaxies. For example, if the u-g index is high then the object is brighter in ultra violet frequencies than it is in visible green frequencies.\n",

    "# To calculate the redshift of a distant galaxy, the most accurate method is to observe the optical emission lines and measure the shift in wavelength. However, this process can be time consuming and is thus infeasible for large samples.\n",
    "# For many galaxies we simply don't have spectroscopic observations.\n",
    "# Instead, we can calculate the redshift by measuring the flux using a number of different filters and comparing this to models of what we expect galaxies to look like at different redshifts.\n",
    "# In this activity, we will use machine learning to obtain photometric redshifts for a large sample of galaxies. We will use the colour indices (u-g, g-i, r-i and i-z) as our input and a subset of sources with spectroscopic redshifts as the training dataset.\n",

We will look at k-fold cross validation in the next tutorial; where the testing and training are changed to include various combinations of  seperate subsets.\n",
