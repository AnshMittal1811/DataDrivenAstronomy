    "# You can write all your code for this course in Grok Learning. You must submit your solutions through Grok for automatic marking.\n",
    "# However, we want you to run Python on your own device too!\n",
    "# This allows you to run your code offline and help you understand how the Python interpreter works. You can compare running time and memory usage on the Grok AWS servers to your own machine.\n",
    "# Later on, when we're working with really large datasets, we'll only use a small sample of them on Grok, but we'll provide additional ones for you to download to run on your machine.\n",
    "# Python is platform independent. The interpreter runs on Windows, Mac OS or Linux (and many other) operating systems. You can download it from the official Python website www.python.org.\n",
    "# You will find an extensive documentation and detailed installation instructions specific to your platform on this site.\n",
    "# There are two major versions available: Python 2.x and Python 3.x. The former is still widely used but is no longer actively developed, so we recommend using Python 3.x for new projects.\n",

    "# Python's standard library includes modules for solving a wide range of data processing tasks.\n",
    "# However, for scientific computing and data analysis, the Python developer community has created packages that simplify numerical computing and optimise performance on large data sets.\n",

    "# NumPy – support for numerical computing and matrices;\n",
    "# SciPy – fundamental libraries for scientific computing;\n",
    "# Matplotlib – powerful plotting and data visualisation;\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Packages like NumPy and Astropy are not included in the standard Python installation. You need to install these packages separately.\n",
    "# Packages usually have installation instructions on their website.\n",
    "# Two common approaches are using:\n",
    "# a binary installer (you must use the right version for your Python version, operating system and CPU);\n",
    "# Python's pip installation tool.\n",
    "# Alternatively, you can use custom Python installations such as Enthought Canopy, Anaconda Python or Python(x, y) that include a large number of scientific and engineering packages. Anaconda and Python(x,y) are completely free, and Canopy is free for students.\n",
    "# One further note is that almost all astronomy software is designed to run on Linux / MacOSX. If you use Windows on your home machine you might want to install a virtual machine if you plan to work in this area in the future.\n"
